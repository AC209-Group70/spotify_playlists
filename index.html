  </div>
    <h2> Linear Regression w/ one feature</h2>
    <p>We just start with the simplest regression model, predicting the number of followers by the mean popularity of all tracks in the playlist. It seems to have low score, and we 
        could take it as the baseline of our target model.</p>
   
    <h2> Linear Regression w/ one feature</h2>
    <p>Then we try to do more complicated regression model, predicting the number of followers by all features we got for playlists
        (include audio features, genre, num of tracks, etc.) The result is better but not ideal.</p>
    
    <h2> Ridge Regression </h2>
    <p>The ridge regression gives an estimate which minimise the sum of square error as well penalizes large estimates. That is why, to improve our score on the dataset, we moved over to Ridge regression.
    It is easy to implement and comes up with relatively good results.</p>
    
    <h2> LASSO Regression </h2>
    <p>The lasso regression does both parameter penalizing and variable selection. It gives better results
    than simple linear regression. In our case, the results are similar to Ridge's.</p>
    
    <h2> Polynomial Regression w/ degree of 2</h2>
    <p> We try this model with different degrees from 1 to 10. It seems degree 2 has the best results.
         However, sometimes the score is bad. So we don't recommend this model.
    </p>
    
    <h2> Generalized Linear Model(209)</h2>
    <img src="data/error.png">
    <p> When we look closer into the linear regression result, we find that the errors are not 
        normally distributed, which prompt us to use the GLM.</p>
    <p>We have previously worked with regression models where the response variable is quantitative and normally distributed. But the data we have here for spotify playlists, doesn't have normally distributed response variable. The response variable 'followers' is discrete and the error terms do not follow normal distribution hence they can be modeled with generalized linear models.
The data here follows a Poisson distribution because the response variable can be counted as whole number, occurences are independent, i.e. one playlist doesnt diminish or increase the chance of other playlist having more number of followers.
    This model gives us relatively good results.</p>
    
    <br>
    <h2> Classification models</h2>
    <p>We divide the class into 8.</p>
    <p>(Class 1: 10 followers or less; Class 2: 100 followers or less; Class 3: 1000 followers; 
        Class 4: 10000 followers ....)</p>
    
    <h2> Random Forest w/ Bag of Words </h2>
    <p>For the first classification model, we use the bag of words to do random forest. The dictionary include the 500 most frequent words. and we created a vector for each playlist.
    We assume that the name of the playlist would affect the number of followers. It turns out there indeed
    is some relationship between the two.</p>
    
    <h2> Multi-logistic Regression</h2>
    <p>The second classification model is a logistic regression model that uses all the quantitative feature from spotipy API.
    We are trying to predict the level of hotness of the playlist. It works just fine, but it is more
        complicated than previous models.</p>
    <h2> Meta Model: combine RF and Multi-logistic</h2>
    <p>The third classification model is a combination of above two models. The weight of these two models is assigned using logistic regression
    This model gives us the best results.</p>
    <h2>Neural Network (209)</h2>
    <p>The fourth classification model is neural network with dropout layers. The input is all the features used in the first two models combined.
    This model is time consuming.</p>
